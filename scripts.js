            abstract={In multi-disciplinary design processes in the field of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), the design of buildings is continuously subject to transformations by the individual disciplines, e.g. when the structural designer makes a structural design for the building using the spatial design of the architect as a starting point. This paper will show that by introducing a scale for evaluating the design stages between the individual disciplines in a cyclic application of transformations, new insights can be obtained into the relationship between spatial and structural design in addition to the overall multi-disciplinary design process. The proposed design stage scale will indicate whether a design is developed to create space (spatially determined) or to create structure (structurally determined). Examples are presented for small-scale buildings and specific transitions. They will show that fundamentals, e.g. diaphragms separate spaces, will automatically be generated by the proposed cyclic application of transformations. The method also allows conclusions to be drawn from the design process, e.g. the spatial design layout will determine whether the ensuing design steps will evolve towards a spatially determined design or towards an integrated design. The idea of cyclic application with evaluation scales can be developed further by applying it to large scale buildings with additional and/or other types of transitions and scales.},

            abstract={To understand the building design process and to help designers involved, the idea of a research engine has been developed: In this engine cyclic transformations take place between spatial and structural building designs. With this engine, a design process can be studied closely and subjected to improvement, and designers can be supported. To develop the engine, in this paper a part of it is studied, namely the transformation from spatial to structural design, which can be divided into four sub transformations: (1) from spatial design to structural topology; (2) from structural topology to mechanical model; (3) from mechanical model to finite element model; (4) from finite element model to design recommendations. For the first sub transformation, two different techniques are presented: Spatial–Structural Transformation Rules and Element Selection. For the second sub transformation, also two techniques are presented: Element Approach and System Approach. Where possible, data models in EXPRESS and process models in IDEF0 are used. For the third and fourth sub transformation, new procedures have been developed using data models in EXPRESS. To test the data and process models for all four sub transformations, a simplified two-storey building, derived from a real six-storey apartment building, is used as case study. It can be concluded that the developed sub transformations function well, related to their application in the research engine, and that their development raises new research questions that have to be solved in the near future.},

These procedures (line–line and line–area) are repeated until convergence occurs. The method is finalised by pattern recognition to find all new areas within the original areas. The second method is also based on (iteratively) checking line–line combinations and line–area combinations but now line–line combinations are studied using a line–area intersection technique and line–area combinations are investigated with a technique that makes (expensive) pattern recognition superfluous. Both methods are implemented in C++ and are compared for correctness and efficiency by using academic and building design examples.

During the transformation from a spatial into a structural design, it is necessary to obtain a stable structural model, so that a structural analysis can be carried out. This article presents four methods to automate the (normally carried out intuitively) stabilisation process, using data related to a structural design’s geometry and its instability modes. The methods all use the null space and associated null vectors of the structural stiffness matrix. Then each null vector is resolved by either (a) rod addition, (b) plane addition, (c) hinge fixation by single rod substitution, or (d) hinge fixation by coupled rod substitution. The methods have been implemented in C++ and several test cases have been carried out. The test cases explain why (a) rod addition provides the most realistic solutions, (b) if several methods are used subsequently for one problem, superfluous elements are inevitable, (c) there is a serious influence on the performance for various systems of key point numbering, (d) the efficiency of the methods is not optimal and may be improved by some suggested strategies.},

            abstract={Commonly used building structures often show a hierarchic layout of structural elements. It can be questioned whether such a layout originates from practical considerations, e.g. related to its construction, or that it is (relatively) optimal from a structural point of view. This paper investigates this question by using topology optimisation in an attempt to generate hierarchical structures. As an arbitrarily standard design case, the principle of a traditional timber floor that spans in one direction is used. The optimisation problem is first solved using classical sensitivity and density filtering. This leads indeed to solutions with a hierarchic layout, but they are practically unusable as the floor boarding is absent. A Heaviside projection is therefore considered next, but this does not solve the problem. Finally, a robust approach is followed, and this does result in a design similar to floor boarding supported by timber joists. The robust approach is then followed to study a floor with an opening, two floors that span in two directions, and an eight-level concrete building. It can be concluded that a hierarchic layout of structural elements likely originates from being optimal from a structural point of view. Also clear is that this conclusion cannot be obtained by means of standard topology optimisation based on sensitivity or density filtering (as often found in commercial finite element codes); robust 3D optimisation is required to obtain a usable, constructible (or in the future: 3D printable) structural design, with a crisp black-and-white density distribution.},

A method to combine the two approaches is proposed, because the two are prospected to supplement each other. Accordingly a toolbox is presented, which can evaluate the structural and thermal performances of a building spatial design to provide a user with the means to define optimisation procedures. A demonstration of the toolbox is given where the toolbox has been used for an elementary implementation of a simulation of co-evolutionary design processes. The optimisation approaches and the toolbox that are presented in this paper will be used in future efforts for research into- and development of optimisation methods for multi-disciplinary building spatial design optimisation.},

            publisher={Elsevier},
            abstract={Two new methods to generate structural system layouts for conceptual building spatial designs are presented. The first method, the design response grammar, uses design rules—configurable by parameters—to develop a structural system layout step by step as a function of a building spatial design's geometry and preliminary assessments of the structural system under development. The second method, design via optimizer assignment, uses an evolutionary algorithm to assign structural components to a building spatial design's geometry. In this work, the methods are demonstrated for two objectives: minimal strain energy (a commonly used objective for structural topology optimization) and minimal structural volume. In a first case study three building spatial designs have been subjected to the methods: Design via optimizer assignment yields a uniformly distributed Pareto front approximation, which incorporates the best performing layouts among both methods. On the other hand, results of the design response grammar show that layouts that correspond to specific positions on the Pareto front (e.g. layouts that perform well for strain energy), share the same parameter configurations among the three different building spatial designs. By generalizing, specific points on the Pareto front approximation have been expressed in terms of parameter configurations. A second case study addresses the use of a generic material and generic dimensions in the assessment of structural system layouts. The study applies a technique similar to topology optimization to optimize the material density distribution of each individual structural component, which can be regarded as a part of determining materials and dimensions in more advanced stages of the design of a system layout. This optimization approach is applied to the layouts that are part of the Pareto front approximations as found by the evolutionary algorithm in the first case study, the study shows that—after optimization—the fronts remain the same qualitatively, suggesting that the methods produce results that are also useful in more advanced design stages. A final case study tests the generalization that is established in the first case study by using the found configurations for the design response grammar, and it is shown that the generated layouts indeed are positioned near the desired positions on the Pareto front approximation found by the evolutionary algorithm. Although the evolutionary algorithm can find better performing solutions among a better distributed Pareto front approximation, the design response grammar uses only a fraction of the computational cost. As such it is concluded that the design response grammar is a promising support tool for the exploration and structural assessment of conceptual building spatial designs. Future research should focus on more types of structural elements; more objectives; new constraints to ensure feasible solutions, especially stress constraints; and the application of state-of-the-art techniques like machine learning to find more generalizations.},

Zoning is the grouping of spaces or sub-parts of spaces such that the resulting spatial layout is logical from a disciplinary perspective. Two automated structural design methods, so-called grammars, have been defined to generate structural designs for zoned building spatial designs. The first grammar, here termed stable design grammar, places structural slabs at the boundaries of a zone, and columns at places where a zone intersects with a space. The second grammar, here termed unstable grammar, generates a structural frame that is unstable by definition. Via a new stabilization method, which is also presented in this work, the unstable structural frame is stabilized by considering the boundaries of a zone for the placement of stabilizing measures. In a case study, the zoning procedure is applied in conjunction with each of the design grammars to three distinct building spatial designs. The case study shows—for both design grammars—that structural designs use less material and are stiffer when they are generated based on a zoned building spatial design. Moreover, the zoning procedure has been tailored such that it yields a subset of all possible zoned designs for which, in general, the generated structural designs perform well.},

The second, simulations of co-evolutionary design processes, can find improved design solutions relatively fast within an unrestricted design search space, however, they typically only find discretely distributed Pareto front approximations. For the third method, hybridization is proposed to combine the first two methods into two new hybrid methods, such that their advantages are combined and their disadvantages are diminished.

Dissimilarity between two prism nets combines three normalized terms: Graph-Edit Distance for adjacency changes, minimal Jaccard distance of matched spaces after rigid rotations and mirrors for shape variation, and mean centroid offset scaled by the enclosing cuboid diagonal for positional change. The measure is symmetric, zero for identical designs and is evaluated in milliseconds. The graph-edit step also provides an optimal relabeling, enabling an automatic ‘diff’ view that pinpoints where the spatial designs of two buildings diverge. The tests in 31 multi-level prototypes show reliable clustering and diversity-driven subset selection, indicating the utility of the measure for design systems, quality diversity search, and data-driven analysis of complex building layouts.},

They pre-process the building representation by partitioning the possibly non-orthogonal design in either conformal quad-hexahedrons (IP) or triangular prisms (TP), allowing applications like meshing, thermal analysis, and zoning to be carried out much more easily. The IP and TP methods are compared for their effectiveness and performance in making NOSBD geometries conformal. Using a test suite of real-world buildings, it is shown that although the IP method delivers quadhexahedron geometries, well-suited for the various applications mentioned, the method cannot always find solutions. Differently, the TP method is superior in this respect, however, it uses triangular prisms, less desirable in certain applications. As such, also a third method is envisioned, which simply passes the complex geometry to the discipline and having repairs taking place there. As an example the application of meshing is investigated with the "tying" method, which uses quadhexahedron geometries and in specific cases \textit{guarantees} solutions. Subsequently, for this specific application, all methods (two making conformal geometries before the application, one repairing issues within the application) can be compared. A mesh convergence study shows that all three methods converge to benchmark solutions, but the IP and TP methods are faster and more stable than the tying method. In conclusion, it is suggested to use for complex geometries the TP method, however, for specific applications the IP method, but then to be improved, may be desirable. For very complex geometry, beyond the scope of this paper, discipline-related repairs may be a last resort, as here demonstrated by the tying method.},

            abstract={Multi-objective evolutionary computation aims to find high quality (Pareto optimal) solutions that represent the trade-off between multiple objectives. Within this field there are a number of key challenges. Among others, this includes constraint handling and the exploration of mixed-integer search spaces. This thesis investigates how these challenges can be handled at the same time, and in particular how they can be applied in the multi-objective optimisation algorithms. These algorithms are developed in the context of the optimisation of building spatial designs, which describe the exterior shape of a building, and the internal division into different spaces. Spatial designs are developed early in the design process, and thus have a large impact on the final building design, and in turn also on the quality of the building. Here the structural and thermal performance of a building are optimised to reduce resource consumption. The main contributions of this thesis are as follows. Firstly, a representation for building spatial designs in is introduced. Secondly, specialised search operators are designed to ensure only feasible solutions will be explored. Thirdly, data about the discovered solutions is analysed to explain the results to domain experts. Finally, a general purpose multi-objective mixed-integer evolutionary algorithm is developed.},

            abstract={In this thesis, the optimization of preliminary building spatial designs is investigated for objectives relevant to structural design (maximum structural stiffness) and building physics (minimum cooling/heating demands). The evaluation of the multi-disciplinary objectives is achieved per discipline using a design grammar that generates a discipline model based on a building spatial design. Two different optimization methods are proposed, each using a tailored representation for building spatial designs. The first optimisation method uses principles observed in design practice to simulate design processes, and it can search a large dynamic range of possible designs, however, it has a low chance to find the best design within the considered ranges. The second method uses state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, which search a limited and static range of possible desings with a high chance to find the best design within that range. Accordingly, the two methods are combined into a new hybrid method, which is shown to enable the search of a large dynamic range of building spatial designs with a high chance to find the best design within the considered ranges. Finally, the possible applications of the developed methods in design practice have been studied, which are: learning new design rules from optimization data, using the design grammars for design support, incorporating the methods into the workflow of a design process, and including objectives from new disciplines.},

This thesis presents four methods to automate the (normally carried out intuitively) stabilisation process, using data related to a structural design’s geometry and its instability modes. The methods all use the null space and associated null vectors of the structural stiffness matrix. Then each null vector is resolved by either (a) rod addition, (b) plane addition, (c) hinge fixation by single rod substitution, or (d) hinge fixation by coupled rod substitution. The methods have been implemented in C++ and several test cases have been carried out. The test cases explain why (a) rod addition provides the most realistic solutions, (b) if several methods are used subsequently for one problem, superfluous elements are inevitable, (c) there is a serious influence on the performance for various systems of key point numbering, (d) the efficiency of the methods is not optimal and may be improved by some suggested strategies.},

A simulation tool was developed to simulate the heat balance of a building and the heating and cooling of spaces. The simulated energy required for heating and cooling of spaces is used to assess the performance of spaces with respect to the building.

This thesis presents a three-dimensional spatial zoning procedure that is focussed on the creation of zoned designs that can be applied in a top-down approach for structural design. This method has been implemented in a toolbox for multidisciplinary building spatial design optimization along with two grammars for the creation of structural models and a stabilization procedure. Several case studies were carried out in which zoned designs were applied in two methods for structural design: (1) the creation of structural models and (2) the stabilization of a structural model. In these methods, the perimeters of either zones (zoned solutions) or spaces (unzoned solution) indicate the allowed locations for structural components or stabilizing structural adjustments. Pareto fronts were used to determine the efficiency of solutions in terms of strain energy and structural volume. This showed that application of spatial zoning to structural design generally has a positive effect on the performance of resultant structural topologies. It was also concluded that the appropriate allowance for space-intersecting zoned designs can have a positive influence on the efficiency of structural models, which was more often true for the creation of structural models than for stabilization.},

            year={2019},
            abstract={This thesis presents two alternative procedures for structural optimization via simulation of a co-evolutionary design process of a conceptual building spatial design. This simulation method applies structural optimization using automated building spatial design modifications that delete the worst-performing spaces and scale and subdivide the best-performing spaces. Structural performance of a building spatial design is expressed by its total sum of strain energy. Both procedures generate building spatial design representations with facade openings: one procedure reassigns a pattern of facade openings every simulation cycle, while the other procedure initializes facade openings only once and applies inheritance of these facade openings during the simulation. A parameter study is performed to study the effects of both procedures on the simulation of a co-evolutionary design process. The results of this parameter study show that the type of facade opening pattern influences the minimization of total strain energy during a building spatial design optimization. Namely, deterministic vertical patterns with a low facade opening ratio lead to larger reduction of the number of stories and therefore minimizes the total strain energy compared to those with higher ratios. Moreover, reassignment of facade opening patterns allows facade opening ratios to be constrained by a user-defined value during the simulation, whereas the inheritance of facade openings decreases openness of facades. Furthermore, the inheritance of facade openings generates substantially more unrealistic building spatial designs with floating spaces. Therefore, the reassignment of facade opening patterns is recommended for further research into development and optimization of conceptual building spatial designs.},

            abstract={This research presents procedures developed for the heuristic optimization of early stage building spatial designs using simulations of co-evolutionary design processes. The research focuses on single disciplinary optimization and it shows that the procedure is capable of optimizing a building spatial design for either structural or building physics performance. Structural performance is defined as the total amount of strain energy, and building physics performance is defined as the thermal energy loss due to heating and cooling of spaces. The constraints for optimization are equal volume, equal space count, no overlap between spaces, and no floating spaces. The procedure is divided into three sub procedures: performance evaluation, space ranking, and building modification. For all stages multiple parameters are developed and elaborated. For the performance evaluation procedure it is shown that structural evaluation should rate spaces from best to worst as highest to lowest strain energy. Building physics evaluation should rate spaces from best to worst as lowest to highest thermal energy loss. Furthermore it can be stated that combining a geometrical clustering approach with the evaluated performances is capable of improving a building spatial design for both disciplines. The space ranking in this study is straightforward since only one discipline is considered at a time. For the building modification sub procedure the most effective parameters are those that move a building spatial design towards the most optimal shape for the given discipline. For structural optimization this means a one storey high, square floor plan. Building physics optimization finds the best solutions when the modifications move the building spatial design towards a cuboid design. Unfortunately, a part of the found solutions result in undesirable building spatial designs. These designs contain spaces that have unrealistic ratios between their height, width and depth.},

The first method, the quad-hexahedron method, generates a conformal model by splitting a quad-hexahedron NOBSD in quadhexahedron geometry entities. The second method, the tetrahedron method, generates a conformal model by splitting the quad-hexahedron NOBSD in tetrahedron geometry entities. Both methods are demonstrated, analysed and compared. As a result, the following conclusions can be made. Future work on the geometry conformal methods is needed, since both methods are not able the obtain a conformal model for all NOBSD. However, the quad-hexahedron method is already able to generate a conformal model for a certain scope of NOBSD and is observed to be suitable for the mentioned use-cases. In addition, the tetrahedron method might be able to make a conformal model for NOBSDs consisting of tetrahedrons.

The Building Spatial design Optimization (BSO) Toolbox is such a design system that uses a conformal model representation to achieve a proper meshing. However, the Building Spatial Design is limited to orthogonal and specific non-orthogonal designs. A new method is developed which ties overlapping finite element meshes to generate structural design solutions. This method is an alternative for the partitioning of the design into a conformal model representation which is currently implemented in the BSO Toolbox. The method consists of several steps, finding the overlapping surfaces in the design, assign master and slave nodes, remove overlapping finite elements, and finally creating a tie. In this thesis the method is explained in detail, a demonstration and analysis on the method is given with a conclusion that the tie method is a promising method that needs further research and refinement for better implementation and greater design possibilities. Further research should be done on the type of matrix used and how to apply matrix operations efficiently to reduce computational time when implementing models with more spaces and finer meshes. Further refinement on the creation of clouds and tying nodes on multiple surfaces is needed for more accurate results. And eventually the use of the tie method on any arbitrary non-orthogonal building spatial design can be examined further for greater design possibilities.},

            abstract={AI agents are increasingly used in building design and engineering. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of AI agents on the human structural design process. This is done by comparing human, human-AI, and AI-automated design processes and products, each approach characterized by a different level of AI involvement. Two AI agents are incorporated: zoning and stabilization. Zoning is the grouping of spaces to search for geometrically relevant shapes in a building, whereas stabilization is a process for preventing kinematic mechanisms in a building. To enable interaction between a human and the AI agent, Graphical User Interfaces were developed, providing a platform for assignments to be executed during this research’s core experiment. Participants’ processes were captured through a linkography analysis and a post-experimental questionnaire. Results from the experiment demonstrated that regarding task-specific products and total time spent, the AI agents used in this study outperformed participants in both the human and human-AI assignments. Although efficient, the AI agents primarily considered strain energy (stiffness) and lacked the ability to combine a multitude of variables. Integration of AI agents within a human design process showed potential, as the efficient AI agents streamlined human processes without diminishing creative freedom. Notably, collaboration with AI agents enhanced human products and processes only when participants defined a problem-solving strategy prior to accepting AI suggestions. Whereas participants who fully relied on AI suggestions from the start performed more poorly than humans without AI support.},

            abstract={The increasing complexity and sustainability challenges in the built environment necessitate more efficient design processes. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising tools to enhance various aspects of building design. Despite significant progress in AI integration, there remains a limited understanding of how different levels of AI involvement affect the design process and its outcomes. Previous studies have highlighted AI’s potential to optimize design parameters but also pointed out its limitations in handling the iterative aspects of the design process. To address these gaps, a design studio experiment was conducted to compare the product and process outcomes of human-only, human-AI collaborative, and AI-only design approaches. The experiment involved participants completing the same design assignment using one of the three approaches. The results demonstrate that AI involvement generally enhances the optimization of structural parameters, particularly in reducing strain energy, although it can sometimes lead to increased structural volume. AI also facilitates the exploration of design possibilities, introducing solutions that human designers might not have considered. The study concludes that effective AI integration can lead to more efficient design solutions, providing valuable insights into the role and impact of AI in the design process.},

            year={2025},
            abstract={Designing high-performance buildings requires addressing conflicting objectives across disciplines such as structural and daylight performance. While computational methods enhance multi-disciplinary optimization, existing workflows often treat these aspects sequentially rather than integrally, limiting their potential. This study aims to explore a co-evolutionary approach integrating structural and daylight objectives during early building design, using the Building Spatial Optimization (BSO) Toolbox. The BSO Toolbox was extended to include daylight analysis, integrating daylight simulation alongside existing structural analysis. In the iterative optimization process, the Building Spatial Designs (BSDs) were adjusted alternately to minimize strain energy (structural objective) and the inverse of the Average Daylight Factor (daylight objective). Simulations were conducted on five different BSDs using varying window height ratios (WHRs). Evaluation criteria included strain energy, the inverse of ADF, and a target-based daylight metric in accordance with the BS EN 17037:2018. Structural optimization produced flatter BSDs with reduced load accumulation, while daylight optimization favored tall, high-building perimeter BSDs (e.g., U- and O-shapes). A clear trade-off was observed: improving one objective often negatively impacted the other. Despite these conflicts, compromised designs improved structural and daylight performance by 80% and 70%, respectively, over initial BSDs. Varying WHRs did not qualitatively alter optimization trends but influenced daylight performance. A co-evolutionary approach effectively balances structural and daylight objectives, improving BSDs over iterations. While U- and O-shaped BSDs performed well, other forms like stepped designs remained challenging to achieve. Future research should study the trade-offs between structural and daylight objectives, explore additional objectives (e.g., thermal performance), and validate real-world applicability. This research demonstrates the potential for integrated, multi-disciplinary optimization on BSDs.},

The Building Spatial Optimization (BSO) Toolbox provides a simulation environment to support this process by optimizing building spaces through multidisciplinary analyses. Traditionally, structural optimization in the BSO Toolbox has relied on Structural Assessment (SA) or topology optimization at the finite element (ETO) or component (CTO) levels. This research introduces a method of Spatial Topology Optimization (STO), which utilizes topology optimization directly on the building space level. A method of performing STO is implemented into the BSO Toolbox and investigated alongside SA, ETO, and CTO through a series of basic case studies. Results show that each topology optimization process aligns with structural engineering principles. STO is investigated in a variety of realistic building design scenarios. The building design studies show STO serves as a viable alternative to SA, enabling consistency across disciplines that optimize via building spaces. However, limitations such as checkerboarding effects and challenges in handling shared geometries highlight areas for refinement. The findings demonstrate STO’s potential to enhance multidisciplinary design optimization workflows and recommend further development to improve integration into co-evolutionary building design processes},

            abstract={During a building design process, a structural designer transforms a spatial design into a structural design and this structural system can be improved by optimisation methods or expert views of other structural designers. The improved structural system allows the architect a new spatial design, which can be transformed or altered again by the architect. This design cycle can be repeated several times and is defined as interaction of spatial and structural design. Case studies are used to demonstrate that this interaction occurs in practice and is needed to improve building quality. This paper presents a program with more or less autonomous spatial and structural generators. Each generator will facilitate one direction in the interaction process. Then using both consecutively leads to a design method that provides interaction between spatial and structural design. For the spatial generator, named “room positioning with structural constraints” a space allocation technique is used including constraints that handle structural boundary conditions. A zone generator based on pattern recognition and shape grammars handle the structural design. A Prolog-2 program was developed to demonstrate the application of the two proposed generators. “Zone generation” is performed per building storey and thus represents a horizontal two-dimensional procedure. Similarly “room positioning with structural constraints” is a planar vertical operation. In future these procedures can be made three-dimensional.},

Two new concepts will be presented to overcome problems for three-dimensional zoning: (1) Geometrically Related Reducers and (2) Matrix Coupling.

A six-level apartment building is used as a case study to test and supplement the data- and process-models for all three transformations.

            year={2009},
            abstract={To understand the spatial and structural building design process and to help designers involved, the idea of a research engine has been developed: In this engine cyclic transformations take place between spatial and structural building designs. With this engine, a design process can be studied closely and subjected to improvement, and designers can be supported. The transformation from spatial to structural design consists of four sub transformations: (1) from spatial design to structural topology, (2) from structural topology to mechanical model, (3) from mechanical model to finite element model, and (4) from finite element model to design recommendations. Because in step (1) architectural elements are transformed into structural elements only, the resulting structural topologies are not a-priori kinematically determined. Therefore, in step (2), one of the problems to solve is the exact description of a kinematically indeterminable topology (at which nodes does spatial freedom exists and in which direction). In this paper a method for this description and its implementation will be presented, developed at RWTH Aachen University during a stay of the first author. The method starts with assigning specific finite elements, which define a relationship between element nodal forces and displacements, to each architectural element: Architectural columns are made by truss-elements, architectural beams with beam-elements, and architectural walls and floors are transformed into flat shell elements. For each element the local stiffness matrix and local coordinate system are calculated, whereafter global element stiffness matrices can be derived. These are merged into a system stiffness matrix, which is subsequently reduced for boundary conditions and reduced elements. Now, the null space of the stiffness matrix can be calculated, using the technique of singular value decomposition, which yields, after some further processing, exactly defined modes of spatial freedom related to the structural topology. The method was implemented for general 3D-cases in C++ and was checked for specific problems, which will also be presented in the paper. For further transformations in the research engine, the modes of spatial freedom should be suppressed, thus resulting in a kinematically determined structure that can be subjected to structural (and later architectural) optimization. In this paper also some suggestions will be made for methods (to be developed), which will make the design kinematically determined. The methods presented, partly implemented and partly in development, will be part of the research engine and as such will provide support to spatial and structural building designers and will provide insight and new developments in the design process of buildings itself.},

            abstract={A research engine is under development for studying the interaction of spatial and structural design processes. The design processes are being implemented as two separate configurable transformation steps; a conversion step and an optimisation step. A significant part of the spatial-to-structural conversion process together with a first version of a visualisation tool have been finalized. Because the interesting parts of spatial and structural designs are typically situated also on the inside of the design, the main goal of the visualisation tool is to make the innards visible from the outside. This has been realised by rendering translucent polygons with opaque outlines. However, care has to be taken in the order in which the translucent polygons are rendered. For an arbitrary set of convex polygons, finding a back to front order may not be as trivial as sorting a set of polygons on the distance to the viewpoint. Also, sets of polygons exist that do not have an explicit depth order. As a solution to this problem, a render engine has been developed that builds a binary space partition tree (BSP) to store the polygons. Another benefit of this BSP variant is that during the construction of the tree, difficult polygon arrangements are dealt with in an elegant matter. Further research involves the development of a complete version of the research engine. The performance of this first version will be compared to case studies. Based on these results, adjustments and additions to the research engine transformations will be made. The final version of the research engine will also be used to experiment on academic designs in order to develop insights in the fundamental relation between space and structure.},

            abstract={Buildings would not exist without a structural design. Although mechanical, electrical, and computer facilities now often put a much higher burden on the financial costs of a building than the structural design -related to both engineering and construction costs-, a building structure is unique in the sense that structural issues cannot be permitted, as they are lifethreatening. Thus a building structure should primarily be safe, but nevertheless also economical. To help structural engineers with these goals, computer-assisted methods exist to determine the stress distribution in structural designs (e.g. the finite element method) and to optimise design components (e.g. topology optimisation). However, research on the optimisation of (complete) building structures is still relatively rare. In this paper, two methods for structural design optimisation have been compared for the application to complete building structural designs. This via a so-called research engine, in which spatial designs are transformed in structural designs, and vice versa, to investigate preliminary design processes. The two methods are compared for their effectiveness of optimisation, which shows that the method topology optimisation is more effective than the method element deletion, and if structural optimisation is used for exploring a solution space and evaluating the design process outcomes, this is an important conclusion. Besides, during topology optimisation a structural design remains stable, whereas element deletion may render the design unstable. However, when structural optimisation is used to study the primarily design process (e.g. via the research engine), the qualitative effects of both methods can be compared, and element deletion is computationally more efficient. Because even an unstable design will be usable in the research engine, for this case the method of element deletion is preferred.},

            abstract={To find structure concepts for building spatial designs, structural elements can be added to a spatial design, preferably at the boundaries of the explicitly defined spaces, and these elements can subsequently be optimised via topology optimisation, which is here defined as strategy I. Another strategy (II) is to interpret the total volume of the spatial design as structural mass -so without defined spaces-, and to optimise the distribution of this mass via 3D topology optimisation, most often naturally yielding (open) spaces as well. In this paper, strategy II is extended by including a movable void explicitly. The final aim is to compare strategies I and II, however, some issues exist with movable voids within gradient-based topology optimisation, and future research needs to explore non-gradient based methods first.},

            abstract={Topology optimisation has been used for a new application that finds structure concepts for building spatial designs. This by a) transforming a spatial design in a uniform structural mass; b) loading the uniform structural mass with horizontal wind loads on each side and vertical live loads on the floors; and c) finding the most optimal mass distribution for minimum strain energy. A spatial design with square ground plan shows that bending moments, caused by wind loads, direct structural mass to the building outer edges, whereas live loads yield a localised mass distribution over the ground plan, similar to a column grid. This behaviour has been verified for circular ground plans as well. Latter plans indicate that the forming of a column grid is not caused by a discontinuous circumference (i.e. the corners) of a square ground plan. Future research will focus on the possible mechanisms of grid formation.},

            abstract={A strategy to perform structural optimisation at early stages of the building design process has been developed. It uses a complete building spatial design as input to generate a structural topology. The latter is converted into a building structural design and a corresponding finite element model. After that, topology optimisation is used to generate an optimal finite element model, which shows an optimal distribution of the finite elements’ relative densities. The optimal finite element models can be used to generate several different and possibly better-performing structural topologies. Examples of two variants (A and B) of the strategy are presented. Strategy variant A uses walls as load-bearing architectural elements, whereas strategy variant B uses bricks (solids) to generate a structural topology. Results show that strategy variant A generates optimal relative density distributions that resemble recognizable structural elements. Also, the structural topologies found are in concordance with the initial building spatial design. On the other hand, strategy variant B is only partly influenced by the initial building spatial design and the resulting optimal relative densities distributions are mainly determined by the prescribed constraints and loads.},

            abstract={Commonly used building structures often show a hierarchic layout of structural elements. It can be questioned whether such a layout originates from practical considerations, e.g. related to its construction, or that it is (relatively) optimal from a structural point of view. This paper investigates this question by using topology optimisation in an attempt to generate a commonly used timber floor. The optimisation is conducted using 3D-volume elements so the topology can differentiate over the height, making a hierarchic layout at least possible. First results show indeed a hierarchic layout, however the floor surface is non-continuous, due to low density areas, reducing its practical applicability. Black and white filtering is proposed via a Heaviside function to avoid the low density areas. Although some implementation issues exist, this function results in a more continuous floor surface, suggesting that a hierarchic layout is optimal from a structural point of view.},

All four strategies are compared using academic spatial designs, and the co-evolutionary strategy is compared with a case study as well. The efficacy of topology optimisation depends on the load type; topology optimisation generates complete 3D building structural designs; and modifying the spatial design may be as effective as topology optimisation. Compared to the co-evolutionary method, the genetic algorithm finds more design alternatives, but converges slowly, however outcomes of both methods are similar. The case study shows that the co-evolutionary strategy provides useful design alternatives, yet is not capable of addressing the level of detail found in practice.

The first procedure reassigns a fixed pattern of facade openings to the spatial design each cycle, whereas the second procedure only assigns a pattern at the start, and modified spaces inherit their openings. For structural peformance, it is concluded that deterministic vertical opening patterns, with a low facade opening ratio, lead to a reduction of the number of stories, and consequently optimise the structural design. Also, it is shown that the first procedure maintains facade opening ratios during simulations, whereas the second procedure leads to decreasing openness, and more unconnected spaces.

The design space has a hierarchical structure, in which decisions on the existence or non-existence of spatial components determine the existence of variables related to these spaces, such as sizing and angles. In the optimization of BSDs it is envisioned to optimize various performance indicators from multiple disciplines in concert, such as structural, functional, thermal, and daylight performance. Existing representations of design spaces suffer from severe limitations, such as only representing orthogonal designs or representing the structures in parametric superstructure, allowing only for limited design variations. This paper proposes prism nets - a new way of representing the search space of BSDs based on triangulations defining space filling collections of triangular prisms that can be combined via coloring parameters to spaces. Prism nets can accommodate for non-orthogonal designs and are flexible in terms of topological variations. We follow the guidelines for representation and operator design proposed in the framework of metric-based evolutionary algorithms. The main contribution of the paper is a detailed discussion of the search space representation and corresponding mutation operators.

This paper presents a simple tying method for early-stage design support systems, in which overlapping surfaces in the design are found. Subsequently, the finite element nodes within so-called point clouds are tied. The method, so far implemented for square surfaces, is verified by three orthogonal designs, for which the strain energy (which is correlated with stiffness) is predicted: The tying method converges to accurate results for finer meshes. Finally, the tying method is demonstrated as working in the background of co-evolutionary spatial-structural design process simulations. The tying method results in the same type of design evolution as simulations that do not need tying, but some differences exist due to sensitivities in the simulations.

            abstract={Indicator-based (multi-objective) diversity optimization aims at finding a set of near (Pareto)optimal solutions that maximizes adiversity indicator, where diversity is typically interpreted as the number of essentially different solutions. Whereas, in the first diversity-oriented evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm, the NOAH algorithm by Ulrich and Thiele, the Solow Polasky Diversity (SP Diversity, also known as Magnitude [1]) served as a metric, other diversity indicators could be considered. We examine the parameter-free Max-Min Diversity and the Riesz s-Energy, which features uniformly distributed solution sets. Focusing on multi-objective diversity optimization, we discuss different diversity indicators from the perspective of indicator-based evolutionary algorithms with multiple objectives. We examine theoretical, computational, and practical properties of these indicators, such as monotonicity in species, twinning, monotonicity in distance, strict monotonicity in distance, uniformity of maximizing point sets, computational effort for a set of size n, single-point contributions, subset selection, and submodularity. We present new theorems—including a proof of the NP-hardness of the Riesz s-Energy Subset Selection Problem—and consolidate existing results from the literature. In the experiments, we apply these indicators in the NOAH algorithm to analyze search dynamics via an example. We study how optimizing one indicator impacts others and propose NOAH-specific modifications for the Max-Min indicator.},

            year={2025},
            abstract={ The inevitable interdependencies and trade-offs between structural and daylight disciplines are rarely researched in multi-disciplinary design simulation and optimisation. As such, this paper presents a development of simulations of co-evolutionary design processes used for optimisation. The simulations entail an iterative process to delete or split spaces of a Building Spatial Design (BSD) according to its structural or daylight performance. Three types of co-evolutionary processes are investigated, i.e. (i) spatial-structural; (ii) spatial-daylight; and (iii) alternately (i) and (ii). Besides, an academic case study is carried out, where a variety of window sizes is considered while performing structural and daylight simulations. As a result, the general tendencies for structural and daylight objectives,their trade-offs, and the conflicts between optimising for structural or daylight performance are showcased. Furthermore, it is noted that co-evolutionary design simulations, if used for optimisation, show large improvements in just a few iterations.},
